## Work in progress...

You've stumbled upon the most exciting thing since sliced bread in the world of research and AI. But guess what? Our README is playing catch up with our awesomeness. It's still a work-in-progress, just like the best of us.

We're on a mission to make Isaac the go-to tool for researchers, scientists, and knowledge workers - basically anyone who loves to blend coffee with groundbreaking ideas.

Join our [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/sJBSV4Fh5k) if you're interested to make your mark in the annals of research tool history or not.

*README to be updated... eventually.*
