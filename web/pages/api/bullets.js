  Here is an example:

  Bullet points:

  - Income is inequally distributed in every country (Bachmann et al., 2019, p.4)
  - In developing countries income is more unequally distributed than in developed countries
  - income inequality is bad for social cohesion and leads to tension in society
  - Politicians should fight income inequality

  Prose:

  Income inequality is a global phenomenon which affects every country worldwide (Bachmann et al., 2019, p.4). However, depending on the development level of a country income inequality can be more or less severe. As such, developing countries show a much higher prevalence of high-income inequality compared to developed countries. This is problematic for many reasons. One of the main problems is that income inequality has a detrimental effect on social cohesion and increases societal tensions. For a developing country that is dealing with many socio-economic issues, this heightens the risk of conflict and destabilisation. Hence, politicians should make the main priority to introduce policies that tackle income inequality.
